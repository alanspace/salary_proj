# salary_proj

This is a project to statisically analyze the data collected from glassdoor via web scraper method with the ide spyder. The aim of the repository to investigate and predict the data scientist salary. Added to it, it can also accelerate my job hunting. 

I got the code from this Githuber:
https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium/blob/master/glassdoor%20scraping.ipynb



I edit the code following the tutorial by Ken Jee. 
https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

Extracting URLS from glassdoor and plug this into the .py file with the keyword data scientist, anywhere in the globe.

# Note:
During codeing, I need to compare code from time to time. This is a good tool for comparison.

I also encounter the similar problem with other YouTuber followers as stated, it may due to the fact that slp_time is not long enough for larger scrapping scale. Three should be no problem with this code "job_button.click()", as the original repo can also run it smoothly. Another problem may be caused by the URL.
